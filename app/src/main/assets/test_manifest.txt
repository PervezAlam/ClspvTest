# Glossary of verbs for manifests
#
# module module-path
# Look for the files {module-path}.spv and {module-path}.spvmap in the assets directory, loading the
# module at runtime. Each entry point in the module will be compiled unless specified by a skip verb
# for that entry point. If entry points associated with a test verb will then also have the
# indicated test function executed on that entry point.
#
# skip entry-point
# Do not even compile entry-point (found in the most recently loaded module), just ignore it. This
# can be useful to work around driver bugs whereby compiling a given entry point has undesirable
# side effects (e.g. crashes the app).
#
# test entry-point test-entry workgroup-size-x workgroup-size-y (test-arg...)
# Run a test, specified by the test-entry name, against the entry-point (found in the most recently
# loaded module). test-entry is matched by a table internal to the application to look up the actual
# test function executed. The test is executed with the indicated workgroup size. Any additional
# test arguments are collected and passed (as a list of strings) to the test function itself. Test
# arguments are, therefore, specific to each test function.
#
# verbosity [full|silent]
# Change the amount of output subsequent tests will emit.
# full - (default) instruct tests to emit as much detail about their results as they can
# silent - instruct tests to emit as little detail about their results as practical
#
# vkValidation [all|none]
# Instruct the test harness how to set up Vulkan validations layers for this test run. Note that
# the vkValidation verb affects all tests (different from verbosity and iterations, for example),
# with the last entry in the manifest affecting all tests in the test run.
# all - (default) install all validation layers before running tests
# none - install no validations layers before running tests
